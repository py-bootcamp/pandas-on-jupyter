Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains.\n",

In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \"all people living in a country\" or \"every atom composing a crystal.\" Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.\n",
